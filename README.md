# bitsyc

`bitsyc` is a compiler for the Bitsy programming language. Bitsy is a small, not-very-useful language. Its primary purpose is to be the best language to implement for programmers wanting to build a compiler or interpreter for the first time.

You can find the language spec document here: [@apbendi/bitsyspec](https://github.com/apbendi/bitsyspec/blob/master/BITSY.md).
